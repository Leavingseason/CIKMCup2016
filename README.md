# CIKMCup2016

This is my working code for CIKM Cup 2016 (https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/11171#learn_the_details-overview)
You can find our report here: https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.03928
Usually during a competition we will explore quite a lot of ideas, so at the last day we make the original code kind of a mess.  I didn't have time to streamline the project yet. However, there are some readers asking about the source code, that's why I upload the original code first. I will refactor the code when I get more free time.
Thanks!
